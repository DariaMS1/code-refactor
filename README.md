# Challenge-1

3RD Attempt:
This was a third attempt at the first Challenge. Since I had issues with my first attempt where I thought we had to change the CSS variables, I decided to try a second time where I did everything similar to here, except when I created the 'improvement' branch on my GitHub (Challenge-1 repo), it only uploaded the README.md file. This somehow deleted the file off my computer and I was unable to see it in the recycling bin.
I started again by copying the HTML, and most of the CSS, code from "second commit" (main) and pasting it directly onto here and re-editing anything that needed changing.
For the CSS code, I copied the '.hero' portion from the starter code as this was something I messed with very early on, and wanted a fresh start.

Hopefully this uploads onto the "improvement" branch and doesn't delete itself (I'll make a copy in case).

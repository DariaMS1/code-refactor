# Challenge-1

3RD Attempt:
This was a third attempt at the first Challenge. Since I had issues with my first attempt where I thought we had to change the CSS variables, I decided to try a second time where I did everything similar to here, except when I created the 'improvement' branch on my GitHub (Challenge-1 repo), it only uploaded the README.md file. This somehow deleted the file off my computer and I was unable to see it in the recycling bin.
I started again by copying the HTML, and most of the CSS, code from "second commit" (main) and pasting it directly onto here and re-editing anything that needed changing.
For the CSS code, I copied the '.hero' portion from the starter code as this was something I messed with very early on, and wanted a fresh start.

Hopefully this uploads onto the "improvement" branch and doesn't delete itself (I'll make a copy in case).

EDIT: I couldn't get it to upload onto the 'improvement' branch and it did indeed delete itself off my computer -luckily I copied the folder and the code in a separate document.

About The Project:
The aim of the project was to make a website more accessible using image descriptions with 'alt' and titles, to help users who are using screen readers or who's images are simply not loading: people with disabilities will be able to view the site, making information widely accessible and therefore increasing engagement. 
The code needed to follow a logical structure in which most programmers will easily read and edit, if needed. The task encouraged the use of efficient/correct syntax in HTML, as well as CSS following the HTML structure in consideration to CSS flow (source order). The CSS needed simplification as the code was overly specific in some areas, as well as slightly disordered.
